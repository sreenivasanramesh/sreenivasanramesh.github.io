Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Sreenivasan Ramesh - a graduate Computer Science student at ASU. Prior to ASU, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at PES Institute of Technology and I have worked as a Software Engineer for two years at a startup, Sprinklr. I love exploring new places, experimenting with food and getting my hands dirty with code. I recently started learning about Deep Learning and this blog details my adventures in Deep Learning, along with a dose of Software Engineering and what not.
